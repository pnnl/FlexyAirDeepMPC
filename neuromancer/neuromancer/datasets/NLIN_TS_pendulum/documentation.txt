% The dynamics of it has been studied in numerous books and articles and
% are well understood. If we choose x1(t) as the angular position [rad] and
% x2(t) as the angular velocity [rad/s] of the pendulum, then it is rather
% straightforward to set up a state-space structure of the following kind:
%
%    d/dt x1(t) = x2(t)
%    d/dt x2(t) = -(g/l)*sin(x1(t)) - (b/(m*l^2))*x2(t)
%
%          y(t) = x1(t)
%
% having parameters (or constants)
%
%    g - the gravity constant [m/s^2]
%    l - the length of the rod of the pendulum [m]
%    b - viscous friction coefficient [Nms/rad]
%    m - the mass of the bob of the pendulum [kg]

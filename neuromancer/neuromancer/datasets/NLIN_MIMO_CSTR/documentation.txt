% Put together, the CSTR has three input signals:
%
%    u_1(t) = C_Af(t)  Concentration of A in inlet feed stream [kgmol/m^3].
%    u_2(t) = T_f(t)   Inlet feed stream temperature [K].
%    u_3(t) = T_j(t)   Jacket coolant temperature [K].
%
% and two output signals:
%
%    y_1(t) = C_A(t)   Concentration of A in reactor tank [kgmol/m^3].
%    y_2(t) = T(t)     Reactor temperature [K].
%
% which also are the natural model states, i.e., y_1(t) = x_1(t) and
% y_2(t) = x_2(t).
% Ts = 0.1;   % 10 samples per hour!

This example shows the grey-box modeling of a large and complex nonlinear system. 
The purpose is to show the ability to use the IDNLGREY model to estimate a large number of parameters (16) 
in a system having many inputs (10) and outputs (5). The system is an aerodynamic body. 
We create a model that predicts the acceleration and velocity of the body using 
the measurements of its velocities (translational and angular) 
and various angles related to its control surfaces.

This file contains a uniformly sampled data set with 501 samples in the variables u and y. The sample time is 0.02 seconds.

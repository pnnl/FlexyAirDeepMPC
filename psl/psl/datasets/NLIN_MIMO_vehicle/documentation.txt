% At this point, we load the available input-output data. This file
% contains data from three different experiments:
%
%    A. Simulated data with high stiffness tires [y1 u1].
%    B. Simulated data with low stiffness tires  [y2 u2].
%    C. Measured data from a Volvo V70           [y3 u3].
%
% In all cases, the sample time Ts = 0.1 seconds.
